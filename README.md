Fake malware created with python.

# WHAT WILL DO TO VICTIM PC

1. Renaming Files (Fake Encryption):
The script will look through the specified directory (target_directory).
Any file it finds will be renamed by adding the extension .encrypted to the end of the filename.
For example, document.txt will be renamed to document.txt.encrypted.
No actual encryption of file content happens—only a name change.
2. Displaying a Fake Ransom Note:
The program will pop up a warning message using the Tkinter library.
The message will say that your files have been "encrypted" and will ask you to "pay" (though no real payment system is involved).
You can close this message, and it will proceed to the next step.
3. Renaming Files Back (Fake Decryption):
After a short pause (simulating a delay), the program will "decrypt" your files by renaming them back to their original filenames (i.e., removing the .encrypted extension).
So, document.txt.encrypted will be renamed back to document.txt.
What won’t happen:
No actual file encryption: The contents of your files will not be altered in any way.
No real harm to data: Since the program only changes filenames, no actual damage will be done to your files.
No malicious activity: The script is entirely local and doesn’t involve any harmful actions like deleting files or demanding real payments.
Important:
You should only run this script in a test directory with dummy files, as renaming files could be inconvenient if done on important data.
The script is meant to simulate how ransomware might behave without performing any destructive actions.
